ldesc: "Lincity is a city simulation game. You are required to build 
and maintain a city. You must feed, house, provide jobs and goods for 
your residents. You can build a sustainable economy with the help of 
renewable energy and recycling, or you can go for broke and build 
rockets to escape from a pollution ridden and resource starved planet, 
it's up to you."
